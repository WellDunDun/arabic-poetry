# Arabic poetry

A collaborative Agent Skill for writing, revising, continuing, and understanding classical and modern Arabic poetry.

Use it for عمودي، تفعيلة، قصيدة نثر, evidence-led meter and rhyme analysis, and revisions that preserve the poet's meaning and voice.

## Quickstart

```sh
npx skills@latest add WellDunDun/arabic-poetry
```

The repository serves one skill, `arabic-poetry`, with writing and interpretation guidance, a local meter scanner, and the optional **Diwan** editing workbench.

Select `arabic-poetry` in your agent. Try requests such as:

- "اكتب قصيدة تفعيلة قصيرة عن العودة إلى البيت."
- "أصلح وزن هذه الأبيات بأقل تغيير، وحافظ على المعنى والقافية."
- "ما نوع هذا الشعر وبحره؟ بيّن التقطيع وما لا يمكن الجزم به."
- "اشرح الصورة والمعنى في هذه القصيدة النثرية من غير افتراض سيرة للشاعر."

## Why it exists

Arabic poetry needs more than fluent phrasing or a guessed meter. This skill connects pronunciation and scansion with meaning, syntax, imagery, and the intended poetic form. It gives classical and modern forms equal standing and distinguishes technical findings from literary preferences.

## Skill

[arabic-poetry](skills/arabic-poetry/SKILL.md) supports composition, continuation, revision, close reading, and form, meter, and rhyme identification. The agent uses the relevant writing, analysis or editing workflow for the request. Quick questions stay in chat; the editor is optional.

Its local Python scanner compares vocalized text against implemented forms of the 16 meters and their configured variations. It reports feet, candidate meters, mismatches and rhyme candidates. Ranking is heuristic, rhyme analysis starts from spelling, and a zero-error alignment still needs a plausible pronunciation and an independent rule check. Scans use ب for short, − for long and = for overlong syllables in pause.

The skill preserves your wording and tashkeel. Preliminary analysis can state reading assumptions; if you ask to approve a proposed vocalization before analysis, it pauses for your review. Repairs must preserve the intended meaning and explain any tradeoff.

Its **Diwan** page keeps poems in host storage or the current browser: confirm the proposed tashkeel word by word, see the scansion update live, ask Claude about any line, and export a poem or the whole collection to Word. AI and shared-storage features require a compatible Claude host; manual editing uses browser storage. Browser Word download also needs the host downloads capability; outside that host, use the CLI exporter. The page loads fonts and its browser Word-export library from CDNs. CLI Word export needs Node.js; optional PDF export also needs LibreOffice and font support. Try:

- "check my poem", with a poem pasted with or without tashkeel.
- "ما بحر هذه الأبيات؟" for a poem you admire.
- "صدّر الديوان PDF مع ملحق التقطيع."

If you previously installed `arabic-prosody`, replace that installation with `arabic-poetry` from this repository. Its scanner, workbench and exporters are now included in the single package.
